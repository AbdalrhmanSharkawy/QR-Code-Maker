QR-Code-Maker is a Python script that allows users to generate QR codes from text or URLs. The script uses the qrcode library to generate the codes and the Pillow library to display them.

The QR-Code-Maker script is open-source, which means that its source code is publicly available for anyone to view, modify, or distribute. The script is licensed under the MIT License, which allows for the code to be used, modified, and distributed for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

The script's source code is written in Python, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Python is a popular language for developing web applications, scientific computing, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

The QR-Code-Maker script uses the qrcode library, a Python library that allows for the creation of QR codes. The library is easy to use and can be installed using Python's pip package manager.

The Pillow library is also used in the script to display the generated QR codes. Pillow is a Python Imaging Library that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many image file formats. It is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

Overall, the QR-Code-Maker script is a simple and useful tool for generating QR codes from text or URLs, and its open-source code allows for the community to contribute to its development and improvement.
